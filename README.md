This project creates a library/libraries for the ESP32-C6-Devkit1 that will use bluetooth low energy to create a something simmilar to a mesh network.
The main goal of this project is to create a control library that will allow one controller to act as a main controller, and a listener library that will be active on all the other controllers connected to the head.

the head library will make sure they are connected in a effiecent fashion. Fast connection and disconnection is not a priority, as the main use will be growing plants.

the listener library will act like an information collection or pass through chip to connect to other chips.

This language can be used in C++ and can be called with the NetworkControl and NetworkListener commands
the following methods are contained in the libraries
