Ping-Based Bluetooth Communication Class File

Nicholas Reale - Ping Testing, Mapping
C.J. Stubbs - Hardware Testing, Initial Net Setup

Problem Statement: The aim of this project is to create a class file that allows multiple devices to connect in a relay using bluetooth connectivity by passing a function name into the class declaration for setup purposes. 

Scope: Class file that doesn’t care about the hardware it is running on, meaning it needs low memory usage, and has a fast run time. The net of devices will be established using a ping-based map that will be stored at the hub’s location. It will be regularly updated to ensure that the net is working at the most optimal speed and largest connection range. The devices should be able to send information to each other once connected, this will include binary verification to ensure there is no data loss.

Technologies: Raspberry Pi, ESP8266 (Arduino), C/C++

Justification: This will serve as the basis for a component of our Engineering Senior Design Project that will require this form of communication before the rest of our project can be made. This feature’s performance will be the cornerstone of our decision-making process for the project.
